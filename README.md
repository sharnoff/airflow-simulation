# airflow-simulation

This repository stores the code and paper for my 3rd-year undergrad Computer Science project at the
University of Oxford.

## Installation & Running

The code is in Rust. To get a working Rust compiler, see: [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/).

Once a Rust toolchain has been installed, running the binary for this project can be done with:
```
cargo run --release
```
