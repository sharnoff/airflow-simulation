## Data

Results from experiments. Each directory corresponds to the results from running the experiment
script with that name.

Currently, it's all empty -- the reason for that being that the size of the data builds up quickly,
and I don't want that polluting the git repo (the size can balloon quickly). A compressed tarfile is
stored with my local copy & can be made available upon request.

For more info, see [Experiments](../experiments).
