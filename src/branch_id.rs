//! Wrapper module for [`BranchId`]

use crate::BranchKind;

/// Unique identifier for a [`Branch`]
///
/// The type of the branch (either [`Bifurcation`] or [`AcinarRegion`]) is encoded in the least
/// significant bit of the value, which means that the `i`th `Bifurcation` is actually given the id
/// `2*i` and the `i`th `AcinarRegion` is `2*i + 1`.
///
/// For this reason, the API of `BranchId`s is restricted to keep this invariant held correctly.
///
/// One side effect is that we only allow up to `isize::MAX` of either branch type, instead of
/// `usize::MAX` of the two combined. This really shouldn't matter in practice.
