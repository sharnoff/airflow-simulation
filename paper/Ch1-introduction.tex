\section{Introduction}

Outline (generally pretty short; most of the introductory information is in ``Background''):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation -- the lungs are generally pretty complicated, and respiratory diseases are all
        too common. It would be really useful to get more insight into what happens as they move
        further away from ``normal'' functioning, but the ethics board wouldn't be happy if we
        started damaging patient's lungs ``for science''. So computational models are a natural
        solution. Historically, they've been difficult to 
    \item Contributions to the field -- basically, a new tool to play with. This should be really
        useful to people looking to find new results about \textit{how} the lungs get impacted by
        various diseases. To kick-start this, we've investigated the effects of a couple \textlangle
        diseases?  changes in lung morphology? \textrangle
\end{itemize}
