\section{Introduction}

General ideas: \\
Full fluid dynamics simulations of the lungs is difficult. Thankfully, we don't need that. We can
get pretty accurate results by building on Brody's work, simulating airflow as 1D and
incompressible.

Using this model allows us to model how the airflow changes under a number of conditions, e.g.
damage to the alveoli in a region, constricting bronchioles, etc.
