Detecting changes in human lung morphology and determining its effects on lung function requires
significant time committment per patient, so statistical analysis on many individuals is infeasible.
Computational models of the lung are therefore a natural choice for researching the effects of
altered lung morphology, with reference to existing lung function tests.

Accurate computational models also allow investigation into properties of the lungs that cannot
feasibly be measured; e.g., increased internal stress in one location from damaged airways
elsewhere.

This paper builds on recent advancements in modelling airflow in the lungs (e.g.,
\cite{FoyEtAl2017}) to create a tool for efficient, accurate computational models of the lungs that
supports mid-simulation alterations to lung morphology. We use a fraction of the capabilities of
this tool to investigate the effects of whole and partial-lung constriction.
