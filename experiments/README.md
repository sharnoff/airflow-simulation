## Experiments


A collection of scripts for running the various experiments performed for the paper.

Each file must be run from the repostiory root, e.g.:
```sh
$ experiments/degrade-and-return.py
```

Most modifications to experiments are done from *within* the files themselves, with a list of
variables defined near the top of the file.
